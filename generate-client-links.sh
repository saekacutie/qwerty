# CLIENT LINK / CONFIG GENERATOR
# ==============================================================================
# ECH config list and certificate SHA-256 pinning are NOT server-side Xray
# settings in this stack. The server inbounds here listen on plaintext
# 127.0.0.1 - TLS is terminated upstream of Xray entirely (by Cloud Run's
# managed cert, or by whatever fronts your GCE/GKE deploy). There is no
# TLS handshake inside the container for ECH or pinning to attach to.
#
# Both settings are properties of the CLIENT's TLS dial to whatever host:port
# it connects to:
#   - fp (uTLS fingerprint)  shapes the client's ClientHello to look like a
#     real browser, independent of who terminates TLS on the other end.
#   - ECH config list         comes from a DNS HTTPS/SVCB record published for
#     the domain, and tells the client how to encrypt its SNI in that hello.
#   - pinned cert SHA-256     is the client checking the actual leaf cert it
#     gets back matches what you expect (defends against a MITM presenting a
#     different, still-valid cert for the same name).
# All three are genuine anti-DPI / anti-MITM protections, they just apply on
# the client's outbound TLS dial, not on the server JSON you asked me to add
# them to.
#
# NOTE ALSO: certificate pinning has no defined slot in the informal
# vless://, vmess://, trojan:// share-link formats, and ECH-in-URI is only
# understood by a handful of very recent xray-based clients. This script
# therefore emits BOTH a share-link (best-effort, works everywhere for
# fp+sni) AND a full JSON outbound config (authoritative, supports pinning
# and ECH reliably in any Xray/V2Ray-core-based client).
